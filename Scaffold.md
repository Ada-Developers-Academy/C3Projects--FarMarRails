## Baseline
Before you start writing _any_ code:

- (done) Review the requirements with your partner
- (done) Create a Trello board
  - (done) Organize your tasks/stories
  - Discuss who will do which tasks and when you will target completion
    - What things should be done together as pairs vs individually?
  - (done, but will iterate) Organize your tasks/stories into iterations (a.k.a waves)
    - Wave 1 (pairing) :
      - (done) gemset, news rails app
      - (done) seed the db
      - plan and execute routes
        - (done) markets
        - vendors
        - sales & products?
      - (done) generate models
      - (done)generate controllers
        - (done) markets
        - (done) vendors
        - (done) sales & products?
    -Wave 2:
      - start with Overall, revisit then
    -Wave 3:
      -Market
    -Wave 4:
      - part 1 - Vendor & products
      - part 2 - Vendor & sales

- (done) Create an ERD diagram based on the original data [specification](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/C3Projects--FarMarFinder)

Once the above is complete, this project:

- (done) requires a shared repo with your partner as a collaborator
- (done )will need to be isolated into a gemset called 'FarMarRails'
  - (done) create the necessary files for RVM to recognize a gemset
- (done) requires you to create a Rails 4.2.2 application
  - conform to Rails conventions on naming and inflection
