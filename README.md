# FarMar Rails
Build a database backed application to view, create, and manage farmers markets as well as their vendors, products, and sales.
In this implementation we'll be seeding with static data, and also building a tool to allow markets and/or vendors to sign up and add their own data.

As you are using ActiveRecord to access the database compare the methods that are given to those you had to create in the CSV implementation of FarMar.

This project is meant to be exploratory. Take time to try to dive into each piece of Rails (routes, controllers, models, views). This project is built so that you and your partner can create the waves yourself based on the dependencies of the requirements given. This project is due Friday 6/26.

## Best Practices
- Use git relentlessly
- Use correct indentation
- Pair program on difficult problems or to share learning experiences.

## Baseline
Before you start writing _any_ code:

- Review the requirements with your partner
- Create a Trello board
  - Organize your tasks/stories
  - Discuss who will do which tasks and when you will target completion
    - What things should be done together as pairs vs individually?
  - Organize your tasks/stories into iterations (a.k.a waves)
- Create an ERD diagram based on the original data [specification](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/C3Projects--FarMarFinder)

Once the above is complete, this project:

- requires a shared repo with your partner as a collaborator
- will need to be isolated into a gemset called 'FarMarRails'
  - create the necessary files for RVM to recognize a gemset
- requires you to create a Rails 4.2.2 application
  - conform to Rails conventions on naming and inflection

## Requirements
However far you and your partner get, the application should have, at a minimum, the following features:
- Seeded data in your database from the original CSV files
- Multiple Active Record models
- RESTful routing
- Deployed application to Heroku
- A "look and feel" that will make you and your partner happy!
